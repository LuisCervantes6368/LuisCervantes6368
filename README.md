- 👋 Hi, I’m @LuisCervantes6368
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding and artificial intelligence, with a special focus on neural networks and environmental modeling. I’m also exploring cognitive neuroscience and occasionally dabbling in carpentry for creativity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning How to enhance my coding projects with Expo Go and refine my Python and JavaScript skills. I’m also diving deeper into air quality prediction models and neural network optimization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Projects related to environmental data analysis, app development
- 📫 How to reach me Email: luisfelipebarreracervantes@gmail.com and phone: 772-155-6368
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, I enjoy learning about carpentry and how to bring ideas to life with my own two hands.
